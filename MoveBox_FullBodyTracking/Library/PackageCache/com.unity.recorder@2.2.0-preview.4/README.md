# UNITY RECORDER

Use the Unity Recorder to capture and save in-game data during [Play Mode](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GameView.html). For example, use the Unity Recorder to capture and save gameplay as an MP4 file.

A recorder specifies details for creating a recording, including a data source, resolution, and output format. The Unity Recorder package includes the following recorders:

* __Animation Recorder__: generates an animation clip in ANIM format.

* __Movie Recorder__: generates a video in MP4 or WebM format.

* __Image Recorder__: generates a sequence of image files in JPEG, PNG, or OpenEXR format.

* __GIF Recorder__: generates an animated GIF file.

The Unity Recorder also supports [Timeline](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/TimelineSection.html). Use Recorder tracks and clips to trigger recording sessions from Timeline instances.
