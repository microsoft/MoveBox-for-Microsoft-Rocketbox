## Managing Recorder lists

You can save all of the Recorders in the Recorder List pane as a single reusable asset. This is useful to quickly switch between sets of Recorders.

To save, load, or clear settings for all Recorders:

1. Open the Recorder window (menu: **Windows > General > Recorder > Recorder window**).

2. In the Recorder list, click the drop-down menu.

3. Do one of the following:

    * To save your Recorder list as an asset, select **Save Recorder List**.

    * To load a Recorder list, select **Load Recorder List > _[LIST ASSET]_**.

    * To delete all Recorders in your list, select **Clear Recorder List**.

## Creating Recorder Presets

Use the Preset icon ![](Images/IconPreset.png) in the Recorder Properties pane to save any Recorder's properties as a Preset, or load a Recorder Preset onto a new Recorder.

This is useful for creating predefined Recorders that you can reuse in different [Recorder Lists](#ManageRecorderLists).

For information about saving and loading Presets, see the [Presets](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Presets.html) section in the Unity Manual.
